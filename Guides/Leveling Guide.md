# Leveling Guide

Kettu has a leveling system that allows users to level and rank up just by chatting! This can encourage users to chat, give rewards to users and could even be used to help with moderation! Unlike most other bots, Kettu allows the user to set if, when, and how they want to be notified of level and rankups. 

## What commands are there?

Kettu leveling has 4 commands, 2 for users and 2 for sever admins

Down below is a list of all the ways it handles channels

- Rank [user] — Shows a user their level or another's if another user is provided

- Levels — Returns the top 10 users with their rank and info, as well as where that compares to you

- SetLevel [user] [level] [method] — Allows to you to set, add, or remove levels from a user. Users roles are automatically updated after this command if any changes occurred

- setXP [user] [xp] [method] — Allows to you to set, add, or remove xp from a user. Users roles are automatically updated after this command if any changes occurred


## How does it work?

Every message, with a one minute cooldown, can earn between 15 and 25 XP. Each Level exponential increases the amount of XP required (exactly like mee6).

Once you reach certain rank thresholds set by the server you can earn roles as rewards.

Servers however can set roles and channels that can be ignored. It is best to check your server settings by using the rank command and using the embedded buttons

## How to setup

To get started, either run the settings command or head to [our dashboard](https://kettu.cc/dash).

From there you can setup settings, such as ranks, ignores roles and channels, wether or not members lose XP when they leave the server and more!

Leveling data can be directly migrated from mee6 for free allowing for a seemly transition.
