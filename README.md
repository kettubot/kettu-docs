# kettu-docs

This repository is used to edit & maintain Kettu's v4 Documentation, which can be accessed [here](https://kettu.cc/docs). For more information on Kettu, head to our [website](https://kettu.cc).

All files and folders in this repository are located under `/docs` based on their paths. The only exceptions are `Home.md` which is displayed at `/docs` instead of `/docs/home`, and `404.md` which is used as a 404 page. Documentation in the `beta` branch appears on our [development site](https://dev.kettu.cc/docs).

Markdown is rendered using [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked), and code is rendered using [Highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js).

Contributions are welcome!
