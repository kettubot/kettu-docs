# kettu-docs

This repository is used to edit & maintain Kettu's v4 Documentation, which can be accessed [here](https://kettu.cc/docs). For more information on Kettu, head to our [website](https://kettu.cc).

All files and folders are mapped under `/docs` by lowercasing and hyphenating their names. The only exception is `Home.md` which is displayed at `/docs` instead of `/docs/home`. Documentation in the `beta` branch appears on our [development site](https://dev.kettu.cc/docs).

MDX is supported.

Contributions are welcome!
