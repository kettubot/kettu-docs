# Kettu Documentation

Welcome to Kettu's documentation. Kettu is a fully safe for work (SFW) furry Discord bot designed to keep your server members happy and safe. You can invite Kettu [here](https://kettu.cc/invite?ref=docs).

When you invite Kettu into your server the default text prefix will be `k!` as well as Discord slash commands. Most commands run both on slash and text commands but some expectations exist. Likewise most commands act the same across text and slash commands but some expectations exist.

`[]` Optional augments.

`<>` Required augments.

`k!` Text prefix, default is k! but this can be changed by the server.
