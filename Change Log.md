## Version 3.1.6

Added the ability to log raw moderation actions in the modlogs (bans, kicks, mutes). The mod log will say manual instead of giving a context link. This will not be enabled by default.

Added the command rawlog to toggle the feature above.

Added the raw log setting to the settings command.

Added note about the raw log after you set the modlog channel.

Fixed bug in the history command that would cause it break if you where searching a user without a profile picture.

Fixed another bug causing strikes to not be stored correctly. 

Some minor code clean up and optimization.

## Version 3.1.6

Added the command `k!takeemote` to add emotes into your sever by posting an emote and giving it a name.

Added the command `k!socialImage` which allows servers to globally disable social images (instead of having to use {noembed} in every channel topic). This option is also available on the [dashboard](https://kettu.cc/dash).

Overhauled the `k!id` command, it is now designed for emotes and neatly gives out an emote ID, helpful for emote servers.

Fixed the `k!about` command so it can now properly work in DMs.

Fixed a few bugs and typos.

## Version 3.0.0

### General Improvements

One of the most important changes to come in V3 is support for sharding. This allows Kettu to scale above 2500 servers. Another much needed change was moving to a proper non-relational database. This allows us to store a lot more data than just server prefixes. Some front end improvements include being able to mention the bot as a prefix in addition to the server prefix. The prefix is also no longer case sensitive, meaning if your prefix is `prefix` you can do `prefixping` or `PREFIXping` or for the heck of it `PrEfIxping`.

### New Commands
