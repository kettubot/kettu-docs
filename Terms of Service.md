These Terms of Service, including our [Privacy Policy](/docs/privacy-policy), act as a legal agreement between Kettu ("we", "us", "our") and yourself. They apply as an extension of Discord's  [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).

"Kettu" refers to the following services: the Discord bot "Kettu" (including any beta versions such as "Baby Kettu"), Kettu's Website (any web services accessible under `kettu.cc` or `*.kettu.cc`), Kettu's API, and the Discord bots "Sir Foxy" and "Gideon's Butler". When we say "Kettu", "we", "us", and "our" in these terms, we are referring to all of the above services.

By using and interacting with any of the services, you agree to abide by the terms outlined in this document, which includes by extension Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).

We encourage you to regularly review these terms and the associated [Privacy Policy](/docs/privacy-policy). We will regularly update these resources as changes are made to Kettu's services, and in some cases we may choose to notify users of such updates through announcements in our support server. We will always provide a way to access previous revisions of these documents.

## Conditions

See [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) for the interpretations of key words in this document.

### For all services

- You MUST NOT use the services to violate Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) or [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).
- You MUST NOT abuse, exploit, or misuse the services in any way, including but not limited to automated usage* and accessing the services in an unreasonably fast manner (such as spamming the Discord bot or performing a Denial of Service attack).
- You MUST NOT use the services to distribute Not Safe for Work ("NSFW") content in areas where age verification is not enforced.
- You MUST NOT use the services in any way that violates any party's personal, intellectual, or other rights.
- You MUST NOT use the services to violate any international laws or regulations.

\* There exists a single exception to automated usage in the context of Kettu's API, which is explained below.

### For Kettu's API

These specific conditions apply exclusively to the usage of Kettu's API, in situations where the API is *directly accessed* through a *program or other means*. Interacting with Kettu's API indirectly through a bot or other website falls under the above category of 'all services'.

- You MAY perform automated usage of Kettu's API within resonable boundaries.
- You MUST comply with Discord's [Developer Terms of Service](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/terms-of-service) and [Developer Policy](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-policy), in the context of both Discord's API and Kettu's API.
- You MUST NOT attempt to exceed or circumvent ratelimiting functionality within Kettu's API.
- You MUST NOT attempt to abuse, exploit, or misuse Kettu's API in any way, including but not limited to attempting to access resources/functionality that is beyond the scope of the user's permissions.

Essentially, Kettu's API should be treated as an extension of Discord's API in terms of appropriate usage, especially regarding user data. The following points are already defined in Discord's [Developer Policy](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-policy), but some of them will be re-iterated here.

- You MUST NOT disclose any data from Kettu's API to any ad network, data broker, or other advertising or monetization related service.
- You MUST NOT contravene Discord’s Privacy Policy or Kettu's Privacy Policy.
- You MUST NOT use Kettu's API in any way that doesn’t comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and third party rights.

## Restrictions

We reserve the right to prevent any user from interacting with our services at any time, and for any reason. This includes violation of these terms, and these restrictions may be performed automatically in more significant cases.

If you believe you have been incorrectly restricted from any of our services, you should contact us.

## Third-Party Services

We may provide use of a third-party service within or in conjunction to our services, or provide a link to such a service. This does not indicate endorsement of said services, and we do not take responsibility for the actions taken by these third-party services. You agree that we are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage as a result of interactions with these services.
