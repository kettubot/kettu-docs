These Terms of Service, including our [Privacy Policy](/docs/privacy-policy), act as a legal agreement between Kettu ("we", "us", "our") and yourself. By using and interacting with any of the services, you agree to abide by the terms outlined in this document.

"Kettu" refers to the following services: the Discord bot "Kettu" (including the beta versions "Baby Kettu", "Kettu Beta" and "Kettu Gamma"), Kettu's Websites (which encompasses any web services accessible via `kettu.cc` or `*.kettu.cc`), Kettu's API, and additionally the Discord bots "Sir Foxy" and "Gideon's Butler". When we say "Kettu", "we", "us", and "our" in these terms, we are referring to all of the above services.

We encourage you to regularly review these terms and the associated [Privacy Policy](/docs/privacy-policy). We will regularly update these resources as changes are made to the services, and in more significant cases we may notify users of such updates through announcements in our support server. We will always provide a way to access previous revisions of these documents.

## Conditions

See [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) for the interpretations of key words in this document.

### Category A: For all services

- You MUST NOT use the services to violate Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) or [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).
- You MUST NOT abuse, exploit, or misuse the services in any way, including but not limited to automated usage and accessing the services in an unreasonably fast manner (such as spamming the Discord bot or performing a Denial of Service attack).
- You MUST NOT use the services to distribute Not Safe for Work ("NSFW") content in areas where age verification is not enforced.
- You MUST NOT use the services in any way that violates any party's personal, intellectual, or other rights.
- You MUST NOT use the services to violate any international laws or regulations.

### Category B: Additional conditions for Kettu's API

These specific conditions apply in addition to those above in 'Category A', exclusively for the usage of Kettu's API in situations where the API is directly accessed. Where a condition in 'Category B' conflicts with one in 'Category A', the condition in 'Category B' takes priority.

Interacting with Kettu's API indirectly through a Discord bot or other web service falls under 'Category A' only, and does not include conditions in 'Category B'.

- You MAY perform automated usage of Kettu's API within resonable boundaries.
- You MUST comply with Discord's [Developer Terms of Service](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/terms-of-service) and [Developer Policy](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-policy) as if Kettu's API were an extension of Discord's API.
- You MUST NOT attempt to abuse, exploit, or misuse Kettu's API in any way, including but not limited to attempting to access resources/functionality that is beyond the scope of the user's permissions.
- You MUST NOT contravene Kettu's Privacy Policy.
