Last updated & effective: April 2, 2024.

---

These Terms of Service, including our [Privacy Policy](/docs/privacy-policy), act as a legal agreement between Kettu ("we", "us", "our") and yourself. By using and interacting with any of the services, you agree to abide by the terms and conditions outlined in this document.

"Kettu" refers to the following services: the Discord bot "Kettu" (including other versions we operate, "Baby Kettu", "Kettu Beta" and "Kettu Gamma"), Kettu's Websites (encompassing any web services accessible via `kettu.cc` or `*.kettu.cc`), Kettu's API, and additionally the Discord bots "Sir Foxy" and "Gideon's Butler". When we say "Kettu", "we", "us", "our", and "the services" in this document, we are referring to all of the above services.

We encourage you to regularly review these terms and the associated [Privacy Policy](/docs/privacy-policy). We will regularly update these documents when changes are made to the services, and in most cases we will notify users of such updates through announcements in our support server. We will always provide a way to access previous revisions of these documents.

## Conditions

See [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) for the interpretations of key words in this document.

### Category A: For all services

- You MUST NOT use the services to violate Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) or [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).
- You MUST NOT abuse, exploit, or misuse the services in any way, including but not limited to automated usage and accessing the services in an unreasonably fast manner (such as spamming the Discord bot or performing a Denial of Service attack).
- You MUST NOT use the services to distribute Not Safe for Work ("NSFW") content in areas where age verification is not enforced.
- You MUST NOT use the services in any way that violates any party's personal, intellectual, or other rights.
- You MUST NOT use the services to violate any international laws or regulations.

### Category B: Additional conditions for Kettu's API

These conditions apply in addition to those in 'Category A' when interacting with Kettu's API. Where a condition in 'Category B' conflicts with one in 'Category A', the condition in 'Category B' takes priority.

These conditions only apply in situations where Kettu's API is directly accessed. These conditions do not apply when accessing Kettu's API via any of the other services, such as a Discord bot or web-based 'dashboard', and in these cases only the conditions in 'Category A' apply.

- You MAY perform automated usage of Kettu's API within reasonable boundaries.
- You MUST NOT attempt to abuse, exploit, or misuse Kettu's API in any way, including but not limited to attempting to access resources/functionality that is beyond the scope of the user's permissions.
- You MUST NOT contravene Kettu's Privacy Policy.
- You MUST comply with Discord's [Developer Terms of Service](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/terms-of-service) and [Developer Policy](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-policy).
  - You MUST comply with the above Developer Terms of Service and Developer Policy equally when interacting with both Discord and Kettu, acting as though Kettu's API were an extension of Discord's API.

## Restrictions

We reserve the right to prevent any user from interacting with the services at any time and for any reason, including violation of these terms.

If you believe you have been incorrectly restricted from any of the services, you should contact us to resolve the issue.

## Third-Party Services

We may provide use of third-party services within or in conjunction to our services, or provide links to such services.

This does not indicate endorsement of any such services, and we do not take responsibility for the actions taken by these third-party services or for your usage of them. You agree that we are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage as a result of interactions with these services.

## Contact
