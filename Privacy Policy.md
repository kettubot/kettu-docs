This document clarifies the ways in which we (Kettu) collect, store, use and protect your data throughout our services.

This Privacy Policy applies as part of our [Terms of Service](/docs/terms-of-service). Please refer to the Terms of Service for more information about specific definitions including "Kettu" and "the services".

By using any of the services, you agree to abide by the terms described in our [Terms of Service](/docs/terms-of-service). As part of this, you agree to the data outlined in this policy being collected, stored and used by Kettu.

## Data collected

The following list describes all data that Kettu stores and collects through your use of the services, which may be related to you as a user or directly provided by you.

You can delete all guild data including guild configuration data within the `k!settings` command.

### Guild Members

Guild member data is essential when using Kettu's boost messages feature.

Guild member data includes:
  - User ID
  - Guild boosting status

Guild member data is stored if your guild has been audited. You can use the 'Delete Audit' button in the boost messages dashboard to delete this data, however you will need to disable the boost messages feature first.

You can also delete all guild data including guild member data within the `k!settings` command.

Guild case data includes:
  - Moderator ID
  - Target User ID
  - Target User DM status
  - Other general information such as timestamp, number of strikes, etc

You can delete all guild case data within the `k!settings` command. However, this data will be collected again if you continue to use Kettu's moderation commands.

You can also delete all guild data including guild case data within the `k!settings` command.

### Users

User data is essential for Kettu.

User data includes:
  - User ID
  - Permissions (in Kettu)
  - Kettu profile information (badges, votes, bio, color, pronouns, timezone)
  - Social & animal command preferences
  - Temporary storage of your Discord user information

You can use the `k!delete` command to delete all of your user data. However, this data will be collected again if you continue to use Kettu.

### Non-essential Analytics

We collect information about the ways users interact with our services. This data includes usage of Kettu and traffic to our web servers, and it is always anonymised. We only use this data to inform our future development of Kettu.

As part of non-essential analytics, we also keep a record of how many social commands you use with other users. This allows us to reflect this information back to you when requested.

You can use the `k!stoptracking` command to toggle whether or not we collect non-essential analytic data from you in the future, including social command history.

You can use the `k!delete` command to delete all of your user data, including social command history. Since other analytics data is anonymised, we cannot retroactively delete it.

### Monitoring

We use automated monitoring to ensure our services are used legitimately. Monitoring data is collected for a short period of time and includes command usage & API traffic. This data is essential for us to continue operating safely.

## Storage of data

Data is stored in Kettu's network with appropriate security measures in place, and is never exposed to the public. We will take effort to remain transparent and notify you as soon as possible if we believe any breach of data has occurred.

## Usage of data

We store data for the sole purpose of providing functionality in our services, within Discord or through our web services & API.

Under no circumstances is any user data shared with third parties.

## Other concerns

If you have further questions or concerns regarding Kettu's collection, storage, or usage of data, please contact us by [joining our support server](https://kettu.cc/support).
