This document clarifies the ways in which we (Kettu) collect, store, use and protect your data throughout our services.

This Privacy Policy applies as a part of our [Terms of Service](/docs/terms-of-service). Please refer to the Terms of Service for more information about specific definitions including "Kettu" and "the services".

By using and interacting with any of the services, you agree to abide by the terms outlined in our [Terms of Service](/docs/terms-of-service), which by extension means you agree to the data outlined in this policy being collected and stored in order for Kettu to provide full functionality.

## Data collected

Kettu collects and stores the following data through the services:

**Essential data:**

- Guild Configuration
  - Guild ID
  - Prefix
  - Log channel IDs, role IDs, etc
  - *Other configuration settings*

- Cases (previously Punishments)
  - Guild ID
  - Moderator ID (if applicable)
  - User ID (if applicable)
  - Channel ID (if applicable)
  - User DM status (if applicable)
  - *Other general information such as timestamp, strike value, etc*

**Non-essential data:**

This data may be stored when certain features are enabled or it is directly provided by you, but is not essential for operation.

- User Information
  - User ID
  - Kettu permissions & flags (badges)
  - Social & animal command preferences
  - Profile information (bio, color, pronouns, timezone)
  - *Other general cosmetics & settings*

- Guild Channels
  - Channel ID
  - Enabled & disabled commands

- Guild Members
  - User ID
  - Nitro boosting status

**Anonymous analytics:**

In some cases, we store information about the ways users interact with our services. This data is anonymous and only used to inform our development of the services.

- Bot invites (and the source of the invite)
- Guild joins/leaves
- Command usage (including guild-specific command usage)
- Web traffic

**Special Cases:**

For users above a certain permission level, IP verification is used for added security. This means that past IPs are stored in the database for a maximum of two weeks after the last time that IP was used to access any Kettu services. IPs are only stored when they are verified through the DM verification process. *This does not apply to the vast majority of users.*

### Storage of data

All aforementioned data is stored securely in a locally hosted database, which is not publicly accessible.

## Usage of data

Kettu stores data for the sole purpose of providing the advertised functionality for its services, within Discord or through the website & API.

At no point is any data shared with third party services. We take particular care in this regard for Personally Identifiable Information.

Access of data through Kettu's API is closely restricted to only allow access where required for essential functionality.

### Managing Data

Kettu provides a `k!delete` command, which allows any user to clear all of their non-essential 'User Information' data.

### Updates to the policy

We encourage you to regularly review this Privacy Policy and the associated [Terms of Service](/docs/terms-of-service). We will regularly update these resources as changes are made to Kettu's services, and in some cases we may choose to notify users of such updates through announcements in our support server. We will always provide a way to access previous revisions of these documents.

## Other concerns

If you have further questions or concerns regarding Kettu's collection, storage, or usage of data, please contact us by [joining our support server](https://kettu.cc/support).
